Uploaded in the event this aids another project.

If memory serves correctly, the hardware classes were abstracted from the control logic allowing for hardware other than that originally designed for. With this abstraction I wrote some classes allowing the use of the Fusion Brain family.

The sequencer code is original to Brian Peek, and might have been updated in his v2.

Arduino with XBee hardware controls would probably be easy to implement, and were the targeted wireless design in mind for a future milestone.
